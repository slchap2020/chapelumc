<?php
echo "Under the direction of our Director of Caring Ministries and a team of Caring Ministry leaders, volunteers offer spiritual care and support for individual needs on behalf of the whole congregation. Since it would be physically impossible for our pastors to meet all the needs in our large congregation, we follow the Biblical model of the early church by assigning tasks to those who are most gifted in that area. Our volunteers select the area that they feel is the best fit, and we provide training as needed." ;
