We provide childcare for ages 3mos-5th grade during all of our services. Children ages 3 months to two years will be cared for in our nursery. Three-year-olds to Fifth Graders will participate in an age-appropriate lesson that aligns with the Sunday sermon. We do this so you can talk to your children about God throughout the week. We look forward to seeing you and your family at church on Sunday." ;

Children's  Sunday School Classes meet during the school year (Sept. - May) and are available for all school-aged children (Preschool - 5th Grade). Our curriculum, The Gospel Project, takes kids on a Christ-centered, chronological journey through Scripture. Kids will discover how the gospel unfolds from Genesis through Revelation. When kids truly experience the gospel, their hearts are transformed. It is the gospel, not good behavior, that changes everything." ;
