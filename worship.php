<?php
echo "God created us as worshipers, and we seek to make God the center of our worship by responding to who He is and what He has done with our whole selves: heart, soul, mind, and strength (Mark 12:30). As individuals within a community, we orient ourselves to God through music of various styles, prayer, reading and preaching God’s written word, and other creative ways of engaging who God has made us to be. Each week, God gathers us together, nourishes and forms us, and sends us out to be the good in the world by loving God, loving people, and sharing Jesus with the world. There are many areas of this exciting and fun ministry in which you can get involved. We provide training and support, so please reach out and ask questions if you think this might be a good ministry fit." ;
